# [QUIZ ROMCOM](https://ilswh.github.io/quiz-romcom)

I have made a quiz about romcom-movies starring Julia Roberts.

I hope that this quiz will bring back some happy memories, ... and a sense of accomplishment.
The quiz is targetet towards romcom-nerds or even just trivia-lovers.
My hope is that it will be useful for these people just by reminding them of something that makes them happy.

## UX

My design process started with a sketch on paper with pen. A quite simple one.

And as I had a bit time, I decided to add a scoreboard and welcoming text before entering the game.

### Colour Scheme

I chose black and white for clarity and antique white as a background color to create a warmth that exist i romantic movies.

### Typography

As font I chose serif because of my preference and have the cozyness of a book.

## Features

I have five features. First is the startbutton and the introduction. Secondly is the quiz that consist of 12 questions which each has 3 options. Thirdly is the next-button which takes you to a new question.  Fourth is the scoreboard that keeps track of how many right and wrong answers the user have made.. The fifth feature is the restart feature which becomes availble after going through all 12 questions.

### Existing Features

### Future Features

- Radio unordered list

    - Instead of a question, a picture or screenshot of the movie will be shown and the user gets to guess which movie the picture is from.
